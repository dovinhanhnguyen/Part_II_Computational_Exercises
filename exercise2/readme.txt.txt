Core 1:
For small oscillation, experimental result matches quite well with theoretical result.
For small oscillation, the integrator conserves energy well, lost only ~0.05% over 600s.
For undamped, undriven oscillation, the period increases in a non-linear fashion against the amplitude.
For theta0 = pi/2, the period is ~7.6s.

Core 2:
Plots of angular displacement against time for various values of q (which represents damping).
Angular displacement tends to zero as expected (except for when q=0, no damping).
I also include plot of angular velocity for various q values and again they alll tend to zero as expected.
When we switch the driving force on, the patterns became very chaotic.

Sup 1 and Sup 2:
Plots of angular displacement and angular velocity for different initial conditions.
It's a mess!
