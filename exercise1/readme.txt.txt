Core 1, sup 1:
Largest N used: 999
Integral value: 537.89425051
Error: 1.10317967
Plot of Monte-Carlo best estimates.
Plot of standard error (obtained by calculating std deviation from many estimates for each N)
Plot of standard error vs theoretical error, they agree quite well.

Core 2, sup 2: 
Plots of C(u), S(u) for Fresnel integrals.
Plot of Cornu spiral.
Plots of diffraction pattern (relative amplitude and phase).
